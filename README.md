## 📌 Mission Statement
The modern Cloud and DevOps job market is intensely competitive. Candidates often struggle to demonstrate the specific, production-grade skills required by top-tier tech companies. **StackForge** leverages Artificial Intelligence to deconstruct job descriptions and provide a technical roadmap for building high-impact, portfolio-worthy projects.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🔍 Job Description Analyser
Deconstructs any job posting to identify mandatory skills, preferred tools, and "project gaps" in your current profile.

### 🎯 Strategic Project Recommender
Generates 3-5 specific project ideas tailored to your target role, ranked by their ROI for hiring managers.

### 🛠️ One-Click Implementation Blueprints
Provides complete technical blueprints—architecture designs, production-ready file structures, and exact CLI commands (Terraform, Docker, Kubectl)—with a single click.

### 🚀 Production-Grade Upgrader
Critiques existing work against a "Senior Engineer's Checklist" to move projects from student-grade to production-grade quality.
